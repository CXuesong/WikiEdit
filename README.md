# WikiEdit

A stand-alone MediaWiki client application for wiki editors. The application is still in its early development stage.

This Windows application is powered by .NET Framework 4.5. If you're using Windows Vista SP2 or an OS of higher version, it may worth a try.

I wrote this application in order to test out my other wiki-related libraries, [WikiClientLibrary](https://github.com/CXuesong/WikiClientLibrary) and [MwParserFromScratch](https://github.com/CXuesong/MwParserFromScratch). Well, I hope it won't be a disasterâ€¦
